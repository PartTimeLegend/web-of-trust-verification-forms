Web of Trust Verification Forms
===============================

If you are a user of PGP/GPG keys then you likely want to have your key signed at a [Key Signining Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signing_party).

Here is a form you can use for entering the details for your request.

If you want to sign [my keys](https://github.com/PartTimeLegend/PGPKeys) or have me sign yours, then feel free to get in touch.
